# First steps in Python

## Software Carpentry lesson

Access the lesson [Programming with Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/)
at Software Carpentry. At [Setup](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/setup/index.html):

#### Install Python

> If you have already installed Python, go to the next topic.

#### Obtain lesson materials

> Create a directory called `swc-python`, download the file
`python-novice-inflammation-data.zip` and unzip the directory `data`. We will
not use the other file.

Now, start a Jupyter Notebook at the directory `swc-python`. Use the name
`topic-1.ipynb`. We will use this notebook to do the tasks of topic
[`Analyzing Patient Data`](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/01-numpy/index.html).
After finishing this topic, start a new notebook at the
directory `swc-python` with the name `topic-2.ipynb`. Use this notebook to
do the tasks of topic [`Repeating Actions with Loops`](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/02-loop/index.html)
and so on. We will cover the topics 1 to 8. Topics 9 and 10 are bonus.


## Simple Moving Average (SMA)

After finishing the Software Carpentry lesson, you are ready to understand the
application of a [SMA filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Simple_moving_average)
to a synthetic data set. The key points are:

* Create functions at external files
* Create tests with `pytest`
