# Programming exercises

Have you ever tried to solve problems like these:

1. Given a sequence of numbers, compute their squares.
2. Given a positive integer `n`, compute the sum of the first `n` positive integers.
3. Given a positive integer `n`, print the first `n` odd positive integers.
4. Given an real number `x` and a positive integer `n`, compute `x^n` (`x` to the `n`).
5. Given a positive integer `n`, compute the [harmonic number](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HarmonicNumber.html) `H_n`.
6. Consider a region `R` formed by points `(x,y)` satisfying the following conditions: `x > 0`, `y > 0`, `x^2 + y^2 < 1`.
Given a point `(x',y')`, determine if it is within `R`.

The notebook [`prog_ex1.ipynb`](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/birocoles/Disciplina-metodos-computacionais/blob/master/Content/first_steps_Python/programming_exercises/prog_ex1.ipynb)
shows some examples of how to solve the exercise 1.
Try to create notebooks for solving the remaining exercises.
Consider taking a look at the lesson [Programming with Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/)
of the [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/). It will be very helpful.
